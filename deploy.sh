# deploy.sh — ship the latest master to the live bridge, safely.
#
# Pull → sync deps → PREFLIGHT (verify the new code can actually boot) →
# restart. The preflight runs while the OLD process is still serving, so a
# broken deploy leaves the running bridge untouched instead of crash-looping:
# launchd's KeepAlive / systemd's Restart=always would otherwise relaunch a
# non-booting build forever (this is the exact failure mode a bare restart
# hit — pulled code that added `sharp` as a top-level import, with
# node_modules not yet synced).
#
# This is the deliberate, infrequent "ship latest" path. `restart.sh` stays as
# the dumb "just bounce the current code" bounce; it never touches deps.
#
# Works on both hosts the bridge runs on:
#   macOS  — LaunchAgent, restarted with `launchctl kickstart -k`
#   Linux  — systemd unit (setup/service-linux.sh), restarted with `systemctl`
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy.sh            pull, install, preflight, restart, record old PID
#   ./deploy.sh --dry-run  pull, install, preflight — report readiness, NO restart
