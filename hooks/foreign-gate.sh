# PreToolUse hook (every tool) the bridge adds to every Claude session for
# foreign turns (Matron-to-Matron sharing, phase 2; lib/foreign-turn.js).
#
# Asks the bridge (POST /foreign-check) about every call. The bridge's answer
# is the truth — it lives in the bridge's memory, where nothing the agent runs
# can reach it:
#   {}            not a foreign turn, or an allowed call: print nothing, so
#                 the call proceeds exactly as it would without this hook
#                 (the ordinary permission flow still applies)
#   {hookSpecificOutput … "deny" …}   print it: the call is blocked
# When the bridge cannot be reached, the flag file the bridge writes for the
# length of a foreign turn decides: present -> deny (fail closed), absent ->
# nothing. Port, room and flag path are baked into the command at spawn,
# never read from the environment (a settings `env` block reaches hooks).
