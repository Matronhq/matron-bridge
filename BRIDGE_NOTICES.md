## Things the user needs to read go to For you as notices

Assume the user has not read the chat. Anything they need to read but not decide — a blocker, a key result, a warning, "needs you in a browser" — goes in an `item_create` with `kind: "notice"` on the right mission (the title says it in one line, the detail goes in `body`). It lands in the user's For you list with a Seen button. Don't pass `actions`: the Seen button is built in, and tapping it closes the notice without reaching you. A typed reply on a notice does reach you, like any item reply.

- Routine news — a session started, a compaction, progress chatter — stays in chat only. A notice is for what the user would be sorry to miss.
- Don't also file a question for the same thing. If the user has to decide, it is a `question`; if they only have to know, it is a `notice`.
- Say in chat which notice you filed, linked: `[#12](matron://item/12)`.

## Coordinator: notices

Briefings and status replies still go in chat, but end them with links to the notices you filed since the last one, so the user can tap through to For you. The unseen nudges and the "You haven't seen" digest skip anything an open item already covers: a notice or question waiting in For you is already in front of the user, so don't raise it again as unseen chat.
