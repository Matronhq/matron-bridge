// lifted into a testable module, in the style of lib/live-output.js — a plain
// factory index.js wires in. One pump per running Bash command; it tails the
// matron-tee log at `logPath` and feeds `streamAppend(convoId, messageRef,
// offset, chunk, meta)` — lib/journal-publisher.js's ephemeral stream_append.

// Offsets are LOG-FILE BYTE positions, and the server accounts in bytes of
// the chunk it receives — so every chunk this module emits must satisfy
// Buffer.byteLength(chunk) === raw bytes consumed from the file. Command
// output is arbitrary bytes (a `cat` of a binary is legal), and a naive
// buf.toString('utf-8') breaks that invariant: each invalid byte becomes
// U+FFFD (1 byte -> 3), offsets drift, and every later frame trips a
// stream_resync loop. decodeByteExact below is the whole fix.

// Decode a buffer as UTF-8 preserving byte length exactly: every valid
// sequence decodes as itself; every invalid byte becomes one '?' (1 byte);
// a valid-but-incomplete multi-byte sequence at the tail is HELD BACK
// (not consumed) so the next read completes it. Invariant:
// Buffer.byteLength(text) === consumed, always.
